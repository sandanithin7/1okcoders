  <p>  Once when the entire world was
        overburdened by the demons, demigods
        prayed to Lord Vishnu for help.
        Lord Vishnu informed them He would soon
        appear as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki.
        After the marriage of Vasudeva and Devaki,
        while returning home on a chariot driven by
        Kamsa, an ominous voice addressed Kamsa,
        warning him that Devaki's eighth son would
        kill him. <br><center><img src="./krishna1.png.jpg" alt="krihna" width="400" height="500"></center><br> Hearing the omens, Kamsa took up a
        sword to kill Devaki.
        Then, Vasudeva pacified Kamsa. Kamsa did
        not kill Devaki but imprisoned both Vasudeva
        and Devaki.
        As foretold by the Lord, He entered the womb
        of Mother Devaki and all the demigods came
        to offer their prayers.
        Lord Krishna took His birth as the eighth son
        of Vasudeva and Devaki. He appeared in His
        four-handed Vishnu form.
        Vasudeva and Devaki offered their prayers to
        Lord Krishna.
        Then, the Lord ordered Vasudeva to take Him
        to Gokula and exchange Him with the
        daughter born to Mother Yashoda.

At that
time all the doorkeepers were in deep sleep
and the doors automatically opened.
Vasudeva carried Krishna to Gokula.
Lord Anantasesha spread His hoods to give
the Lord shelter.
Reaching Gokula, Vasudeva exchanged
Krishna with the daughter born to Mother
Yashoda and retured back to the prison in
Mathura.
Kamsa tried to kill the newborn child of
Mother Devaki, but the child rose above his
head and appeared as the eight-armed form
of Durga. Mother Durga then told Kamsa that
the Lord had taken birth somewhere else.
Hearing this, Kamsa ordered his men to kill
all children who were born within ten days.
In Gokula, Nanda Maharaja arranged for a
magnificent birth ceremony.<br><center><img src="./krishna2.png.jpg" alt="krihna" width="400" height="500"></center><br>
Fearing Kamsa, Nanda Maharaj secretly
performed the name giving ceremony of
Krishna and Balarama by Garga Muni.
Garga Muni said that the child would have
power, beauty, and opulence, all on the level
of Narayana, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead.
nanda ke ānanda bhāiyo jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī
jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī
hathi dīnī ghoḍā dīnī ane dīnī pālakī
nanda ke ānanda bhāiyo jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī
javāneń ko hāthi ghoḍe buḍḍheń ko palki
nanda ke ānanda bhāiyo jaya kanhaiyā lāl kī
And Krishna became the darling of Vrindavan
because of His uncommon activities

    Kamsa sent Putana demoness, who was
    wandering here and there killing small
    babies. Putana tried to feed Krishna her
    poison smeared breast milk, but Krishna
    sucked her life air and killed her.
    Once when mother Yashoda put Krishna
    underneath a household cart, Krishna kicked
    the cart and killed the demon Shakatasura.
    One day, Trinavarta, one of the servants of
    Kamsa, appeared as a whirlwind and took
    Krishna away.

    <br><center><img src="./krishna.png.jpg" alt="krihna" width="400" height="500"></center><br>
    Krishna grasped the demon by his neck so
    tightly that the demon died immediately.
    Once when baby Krishna yawned, mother
    Yashoda could see within His mouth the
    entire universal manifestation.
    Krishna and Balarama would sometimes steal
    butter from the gopis homes.
    One day, Krishna having been interrupted in
    His business of sucking the breast, became
    very angry. He entered a room and began to
    eat the freshly churned butter.

    When Krishna and Balarama stole butter and
    distributed the butter to the monkeys,
    mother Yashoda chased them with a stick in
    hand.
    As soon as Krishna saw His mother, He
    immediately ran away, and mother Yashoda
    followed Him.
    Krishna cried and rubbed His eyes again and
    again with His two lotus hands. His eyes were
    fearful,
    Mother Yashoda caught Krishna and bound
    Him to a grinding mortar.<br><center><img src="./krishna3.png.jpg" alt="krihna" width="400" height="500"></center><br>
    Krishna crawled with the mortar in the
    courtyard and pulled down the two yamalaarjuna trees, and delivered Nalakuvara and
    Manigriva.
    Nalakuvara and Manigriva were condemned
    by Narada Muni to become trees.
    One day, Krishna took some grain in His little
    palms and went to the vendor to exchange
    the grains for fruit. On the way, almost all the
    grains fell from His palms, only one or two
    grains remained. The fruit vendor, out of full
    affection, accepted these grains in exchange
    for as much fruit as Krishna could take. As
    soon as she did this, her basket became filled
    with gold and jewels.
    Later, fearing the demons, the inhabitants of
    Gokula left Gokula and went to Vrindavana.
    There Krishna killed Vatsasura and Bakasura.
